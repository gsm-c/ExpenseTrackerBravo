Hello, and welcome to the Expense Tracker developed by Bravo Team. To use this, make sure to do a git clone, and have all dependencies and files. The 
expense_tracker.db is the most important because that is what lets SQLite access the database, without having it properly in your IDE, it will not 
let you access the database. You can use the admin account by using admin and admin123 as username and password, respectively.

We have uploaded our use case diagram, out report, and the versions of our class diagram, with the most recent being the png class diagram.
